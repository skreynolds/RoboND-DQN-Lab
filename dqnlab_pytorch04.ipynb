    "In the Q-Learning Lab notebook for this course, you were able to train an agent to balance the OpenAI Gym CartPole using a provided Q-Learning algorithm.  The Q-Learning algorithm read in the environment observations and reward provided by the `gym` CartPole-v0 environment api.  The Q-Learning agent used a table to store all the updated values and simply looked up the best learned value to make decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This works great when we have an environment that can tell us exactly what is going on.  The CartPole-v0 environment provides the exact position, velocity, and angles of the pole!  But what if all we had was a picture of what was happening in the game?  \n",
    "<br><br>So instead of an observation like this (position, velocity, angle, tip velocity):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "observation: [ 0.00326999 -0.17222302  0.01642742  0.30067511]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we have an observation like this (the actual image):\n",
    "<img src=\"image/cartpole.png?\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen in other deep learning problems, a neural network can be trained to \"learn\" distinguishing features from an image. With a Deep Q-Network (DQN), we can learn to solve the CartPole problem by looking at the scene.  Because of this, our results aren't directly comparable to results that use the simpler observation scheme - this is a much harder task. Training is slower, because all frames have to be rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will focus on a patch of the image where the cart exists, and determine the state based on the difference between the current and previous patches. This will allow the agent to take the velocity of the pole into account from one image."
